The objective is to significantly improve this file browser. Features to think about include: a text editor, markdown and code previews, or file changes persisting across reloads.

Install any npm packages or use any third party code you'd like, but please make sure it is clear when you do so.

Once complete, send us a forked GitHub repo link.

Thanks for trying our challenge!
